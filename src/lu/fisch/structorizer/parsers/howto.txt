ADD A NEW LANGUAGE TO STRUCTORIZER IMPORT
=========================================
Author:      Kay Gürtzig
Last update: 2021-02-15

Structorizer uses the GOLD Parser version 5.0 (http://www.goldparser.org) in
combination with a compiled grammar for the source language to derive a structogram
from source code.

You should be familiar with the concepts of grammars, parsers, and compilers and you
should have understood the tree structure Structorizer uses to represent Nassi-
Shneiderman diagrams.

All information you need for GOLD Parser can be found on the GOLDParser website
(http://www.goldparser.org).

1. GRAMMAR FILE
First you need a grammar for the programming language you want to add an import for.
A grammar file as required for GOLD Parser (grm file) is to be written in an easy-to-
understand dialect of EBNF (Enhanced Backus-Naur Form).
Before the grammar rules begin, some preceding lines will have to define the lexical
tokens used by the grammar rules (e.g. number literals, identifiers etc.). These are
(according to the Chomsky type 3 of lexic) defined by some sort of regular expressions.
The documentation is around here: http://goldparser.org/doc/grammars/index.htm.
The grammar handles line comments and block comments if the delimiters are defined
with "Comment Start", "Comment End", and "Comment Line". If alternative comment
delimiters are to be accepted, then the names of the additional group definitions shall
start with "Comment" (see http://www.goldparser.org/doc/grammars/define-groups.htm)
if the generated parser is to be enabled to attach the comments to reductions objects. 
Be aware that the GOLD Parser is a LALR(1) parser which makes it performant but imposes
some restrictions to the way grammar rules are to be formed.
In general, it is a good idea to start with some grammar for a very similar language,
which GOLD Parser is known to work with. You may find examples in this directory and
on the GOLD Parser homepage (http://goldparser.org/grammars/index.htm). 
The optimum tool for editing a grammar file for GOLDParser is the GOLDBuilder.exe you
may download as binary for Windows from:
http://goldparser.org/builder/files/GOLD-Builder-5.2.0-Binary.zip.
It is not only an editor but also integrates the grammar check and the compilation
to the grammar table file. It provides an excellent interactive analysis, which allows
you comfortably to navigate through rule conflicts and the like.  

2. COMPILED GRAMMAR TABLE
Convert the grammar file to a set of compiled grammar tables. If you haven't already
done this with the GOLDBuilder tool mentioned above, it can also be done with a command-
line tool named GOLDbuild. For Windows, a compiled version of it may be downloaded as
GOLDbuild.exe from the following URL:
http://goldparser.org/builder/files/GOLD-Builder-5.2.0-Cmd.zip
Make sure to unzip all the dat files together with the GOLDbuild.exe into the same folder.
The GOLDbuild tool analyzes the grammar and constructs the decision tables for the parser
from them. This takes some seconds and results in an egt file, which contains the tables
for the state-driven LALR(1) parsing engine. If your grammar is for language XYZ then the
command line will simply look like:
GOLDbuild.exe XYZ.grm
This will create a file XYZ.egt by default.
If the grammar is not suited for LALR(1) parsing, however, then you will get some dozens
or more conflict messages but no egt file. In this case you will have to reformulate the
rules until the grammar passes the GOLDbuild process. This may get tricky if the language
itself is intrinsically ambiguous.
Again, the GOLDBuilder (mentioned in section 1) is way more informative and mighty
than the GOLDBuild.exe - it leads you step by step to the grammar table. 

3. PARSER CLASS SKELETON
If you have luckily obtained an egt file (or have downloaded an also suited cgt file -
which is just an older file format for GOLD parser compiled grammar tables) then you
will have to generate a Parser skeleton for this grammar.
Here you will have to use a command-line tool GOLDprog.exe downloaded together with
GOLDbuild (see step 2) as http://goldparser.org/builder/files/GOLD-Builder-5.2.0-Cmd.zip.
In order to create a meaningful parser class you should use StructorizerParserTemplate.pgt
as the template file for GOLDprog.exe:
GOLDprog.exe XYZ.egt StructorizerParserTemplate.pgt XYZParser.java
The states and patterns in the tables are linked to the rules. The command-line tool
GOLDprog derives more or less mnemonic constants for the table indices of symbols and
rules and places them as interface members in the target Java file (XYZParser.java).
(The template file practically contains the Java skeleton of the aimed Parser class,
where certain ## markers specify the insertion places and the syntax according to which
the table index references are generated into the code.)
You will also find some hooks where to add the Nassi-Shneiderman diagram synthesis
(methods initializeBuildNSD(...), buildNSD_R(...), getContent_R(...),
subclassUpdateRoots(...), subclassPostProcess(...)).

4. FILE PREPARATION
Before the parsing begins, usually some file preparations will have to be done. You
should overwrite method prepareTextfile(String _textToParse, String _encoding).
To setup the comment processing, you will need to call registerStatementRuleIds(...)
here.
If the file preparation tends to take a lot of time and you have an idea how to
estimate the overall time tell when certain portion has been done then you should
call method firePropertyChange("progress", oldVal, newVal) on a regular basis,
where oldVal and newVal are to be integer values ranging between 0 and 100, symbolising
the (old and new) percentage of this file preparation phase. The value 100 will be
sent anyway after you leave the routine.

5. DIAGRAM SYNTHESIS FROM SYNTAX TREE
This all done, the diagram synthesis must be written. This is very dependent on the
rules of the used grammar. Whereas the parsing process works bottom up, i.e. from the
input token to the start symbol of the grammar, the diagram synthesis works top down.
When the parsing terminated successfully, i.e. in state ACCEPT, then at first method
initializeBuildNSD is called in order to give you the opportunity to do some language-
specific preparation. Just override this method if there is something to prepare.
Usually you should call method setStatement
Next the recursive method buildNSD_R will be called with the top Reduction of the
grammar and the empty element sub-queue of the new diagram root as arguments. The usual
way to implement it is to pick all Reductions representing some algorithmic entities
to be converted in diagram elements and handle them correspondingly, skip all Reductions
being meaningless for Structorizer, and just recursively traverse the remaining Reductions
with buildNSD_R (else branch).
Where you need the mere parsed text you may call getContent_R on a Reduction instead,
which you will also have to implement for the respective rule-specific Reduction.
The analysis of the element Tokens of the Reduction class is pretty straight-forward.
With method getParent() you obtain the corresponding production rule (including its text,
e.g. "<WhileStatement> ::= WHILE <expression> DO <StatementSequence> END"). The left-
hand side of the rule, here "<WhileStatment>" can be obtained with getHead().
The table index of the rule can be obtained with getTableIndex() on the production rule.
This index may be compared with the generated members of interface RuleConstants to
identify the rule and conclude its structure:
The right-hand side of the production rule determines the structure of the Reduction
elements. In the example above it consists of 5 Tokens (three of type CONTENT (terminal)
and and two of type NON_TERMINAL, in the rule-defined order, i.e. "WHILE", <expression>,
"DO", <StatementSequence>, "END"), hence method size() on the Reduction object would
return 5. You obtain the respective tokens via the get() method, providing the respective
index (0...4). From the identified rule you will know which tokens are terminals and which
are non-terminals. For further analysis, you typically fetch the child reduction of non-
terminal tokens by method asReduction() (on the token), for terminal tokens you will
retrieve their string content by making use of method asString().
The initial diagram Root is held in the member variable root of your Parser class. If you
bump into some subroutine code (a routine declaration Reduction) then you will temporarily
have to move root into the collection subRoots by means of method addRoot() and add a
new Root object, putting it into slot root instead.
Ideally, you have a look at the already existing language-specific parser classes (which
are rather diagram synthesis classes by the way) how they make use of the Reduction tree
generated by the actual generic parser.

Import options are available via members named "option..." of the parent class CodeParser:
- optionImportVarDecl indicates whether variable declarations are to be imported or not
- optionImportComments specifies whether comments from source are to be passed to the elements
- optionSaveParseTree() indicates whether the parse tree is to be saved (no action needed,
  already handled by the parent class!).
Language-dependent options can be configured within the respective <plugin> tag in file
parsers.xml. Each <option> tag is supposed to have the following attributes:
- name: an identifier string used as internal key,
- type: one of "Boolean", "Integer", "Unsigned", "Double", "Character", or "String",
- title: the external caption for the import option dialog (should be English)
- help: A short (English) description used as tooltip popup in the import option dialog.
If the option values are enumerable then instead of the type attribute, a sequence of
<item> subtags should be placed within the <option> tag, each specifying one of the
selectable values in its value attribute.
In order to obtain the value, the parser must use method
	getPluginOption(String key, Object default)

The parent class, CodeParser, provides some standard colors that may be used to mark up
certain kinds of elements:
- colorConst for constant definitions
- colorDecl for mere variable declarations (if imported at all)
- colorGlobal for global definitions (in case of files with multiple routines)
- colorMisc for miscellaneous source language-specific mark-ups (e.g. for related elements
  emerging from a single source code construct like a for(...;...;...) loop in C).
  
 Again, if you think you can contribute to a more precise progress display, you
 send the estimated percentage of build completion every now and then by means of
 method firePropertyChange("progress", oldVal, newVal) in the range 0..100.
 
6. CONFIGURATION OF COMMENT IMPORT
Some configuration is necessary to make comment import from source files work:
List those members of class constant RuleConstants in constant statementIds that
are related to built elements such that the comment retrieval and attachment via
methods
- String retrieveComment(Reduction)
- Element equipWthSourceComment(Element, Reduction)
may work as intended.
 
7. BATCH MODE TEST
It may facilitate the final tests to run the parser in batch mode (i.e. from command line):
	Linux:	 	structorizer.sh  -p -v <logDir> <sourceFile> ...
	Windows: 	structorizer.bat -p -v <logDir> <sourceFile> ...
(For further command-line options see Structorizer User Guide).
