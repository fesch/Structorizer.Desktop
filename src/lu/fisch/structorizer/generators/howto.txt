WRITE A NEW CODE GENERATOR FOR STRUCTORIZER
===========================================
Author:      Kay Gürtzig
Last update: 2019-03-18

There are two possible approaches to add a new generator to Structorizer:
You might start from scratch or copy an existing generator for a language
with as much similarities to your target language as possible and modify
it incrementally.
For the first approach, you should just solve steps 1 and 2 and provide a
rough prototype implementation of the the methods listed in section 3.
There you might simply put the target-specific keywords, blocks, and
indentations for the respective algorithm structur element together with
the element text (untranslated, just as is) to the code StringList, in
order to get familiar with the way the generators work. As soon as the
generator prototype is translatable you might plug it in (see section 7).
Start exporting some very simple diagrams. Then you will soon see what
must be refined and added such that the expressions and statements fit
better into the syntax of the target language. This way you may improve
and accomplish the outcome step by step, consider more export options etc.

1	Derive a new subclass of lu.fisch.structorizer.generators.Generator.

2	Implement the abstract configuration methods:
	2.1	String getDialogTitle()
		Return a title string for the FileChooser dialog (in English!),
		usually "Export (language name) ..."
	2.2	String getFileDescription()
		Return a string to be used by the file filter for the FileChooser
		dialog.
	2.3	String[] getFileExtensions()
		Return a string array (type String[]) containing all source code
		file name extensions (without dot!) to be accepted by the file
		filter, e.g. {"cc", "cpp"} for C++.
	2.4	String getIndent()
		Return a string to be used for a one-level indentation in the
		source, usually	either a tab character or a sequence of space
		characters.
	2.5	String getCommentSymbolLeft()
		Return a string, which opens a delimited comment (e.g. "/*") or
		is used to start a line comment in the target language (e.g. "//"
		for C++). Make sure the non-abstract method getCommentRight() is
		configured accordingly.
	2.6	String getCommentSymbolRight()
		Is not abstract but pre-configured to return an empty string,
		which is perfect for line comments. If the target language doesn't
		know line comments or if getCommentLeft() returns the left delimiter
		of a delimited comment, then you must return the corresponding right
		delimiter here, e.g. "*/".
	2.7	String getInputReplacer(boolean withPrompt)
		Depending on the value of withPrompt return
		true)	a regular substitution pattern for input instructions
				representing an instruction sequence where substring
				"$1" marks the position	where to insert the prompt
				string and substring "$2" marks the position where to
				place the name of the variable to be input, e.g.
				"printf($1); scanf(\"\", &$2)" for C;
		false)	a regular substitution pattern for an input instruction
				without output of a prompt where "$1" marks the place
				to insert the variable name, e.g. "std::cin >> $1" for
				C++.
		The returned pattern should not end with an instruction separator.
	2.8	String getOutputReplacer()
		Return the regular replacement pattern representing an output
		instruction causing a line feed in the end, where a substring "$1"
		marks the place where the transformed output expression (assume
		a single expression here, see later below) is to be placed , e.g.
		"std::cout << $1 << std::endl" for C++.
	2.9	OverloadingLevel getOverloadingLevel()
		Return the level of subroutine signature overloading this language allows:
		OL_NO_OVERLOADING if subroutines may not share their name (e.g. C)
		OL_DELEGATION if overloading is allowed but default arguments are not (e.g. Java)
		OL_DEFAULT_ARGUMENTS if parameters may be given a default value (e.g. C++)
	2.10	boolean isCaseSignificant()
		Return true if case matters for identifying reserved words
		(also see getReservedWords() above) in the target language 
		(e.g. true for Java, false for Pascal).
		If the reserved words (see 2.9) are configured in the plugin file
		(see 7) then you should also configure the handling of letter
		case in the plugin file generators.xml (see 7).
	2.11	boolean breakMatchesCase()
		Specify whether an instruction to leave a loop (the innermost
		enclosing loop) like "break;" in C is available in the target
		language AND ALSO BREAKS CASE SELECTIONS (switch constructs).
		Return true if and only if there is an instruction that does both.
	2.12	String getIncludePattern()
		Return a code line for an include / import / use directive where
		a placeholder "%%" indicates that a comma-separated list of file
		names or module names etc. can be inserted here, or otherwise a "%"
		placeholder is to indicate that only a single item may be inserted
		at that very position (such that several lines will have to be
		generated from this template for a list of items).
	2.13	OverloadingLevel getOverloadingLevel()
		Return an enumerator value indicating whether the language allows
		to overload routines in general or even to specify optional
		arguments (enh. #385, since version 3.29-05).
	2.14	TryCatchSupportLevel getTryCatchLevel()
		Return an enumerator value indicating whether the language doesn't
		provide exception handling or allows try-catch blocks or even
		finally blocks (enh. #56, since version 3.29-07).
		
3	Override the substantial generator methods.
	3.0	General remarks
		There is a method for each structogram element type, obtaining
		the element and the current indentation string as arguments.
		Each of the generateCode methods is to recursively translate
		the structure and its contents to lines of code, which are to
		be appended to the generator's inherited code member (being a
		StringList object). The base class Generator provides bare method
		skeletons showing how to do the recursive descending. On
		overriding these methods you may start from a copy of them and
		fill it with "flesh". Usually the first action of the method
		will be to add the element comment to the code, using method
		insertComment(Element element, String _indent); see sections 5
		and beyond for helper methods and further customization
		opportunities. You will have to respect several export options
		explained in section 4. You will find a lot of examples in the
		existing Generator subclasses.
	3.1	void generateCode(Instruction _inst, String _indent)
		Is to generate the code for the given basic instruction element.
		The code should be enclosed by the following construct:
		if (!insertAsComment(_inst, _indent)) {
			// place actual generator code here
		}
		To translate the instruction you will now fetch the element text
		by _inst.getText() and translate it line for line.
		Class Instruction provides some line-classifying methods like:
		boolean isDeclaration(String line),
		boolean isAssignment(String line),
		boolean isInput(String line),
		boolean isEmptyInput(String line),
		boolean isOutput(String line), or
		boolean isTurtleizerMove(String line).
	3.2	void generateCode(Alternative _alt, String _indent)
		Is to generate the code for the given alternative element,
		including its branches (_alt.qTrue, _alt.qFalse), which are
		to handled by recursive calls of generateCode() at the
		appropriate place.
	3.3	void generateCode(Case _case, String _indent)
		Is to generate the code for the given alternative element,
		including its branches, which are elements of the sub-queue
		Vector _case.qs and to be handled by recursive calls of
		generateCode(). For the structure of the element text see
		Structorizer User Guide and compare the existing Generator
		subclasses.
	3.4	void generateCode(For _for, String _indent)
		A good idea is first to classify the loop style and to delegate
		the handling of FOR-IN loops (aka foreach loops) to another
		method:
		if (_for.isForInLoop())
		{
			// Method generateForInCode returns false if it doesn't
			// cope with the loop structure or decides that it isn't
			// actually a FOR-IN loop but should be handled as ordinary
			// FOR loop
			if (generateForInCode(_for, _indent)) return;
		}
		The rest is straightforward. You may make use of the following
		helper methods of the For element class (for counting loops):
		String For.getCounterVar(),
		String For.getStartValue(),
		String For.getEndValue(),
		int For.getStepConst().
		For FOR-IN loops there are some other helper methods:
		String For.getCounterVar(),
		StringList Generator.extractForInListItems(For _for)
		To replace a non-supported FOR-IN list by an equivalent
		algorithm structure may be tricky, but there are several
		elaborate code examples in various Generator subclasses.
	3.5	void generateCode(While _while, String _insert)
		A specific support for exit jumps is provided by the jumpTable
		inherited and prepared by the base Generator class. It may be
		used to generate jump labels (see generateCode(Jump, String)).
	3.6	void generateCode(Repeat _repeat, String _insert)
		A specific support for exit jumps is provided by the jumpTable
		inherited and prepared by the base Generator class. It may be
	3.7	void generateCode(Forever _forever, String _insert)
		A specific support for exit jumps is provided by the jumpTable
		inherited and prepared by the base Generator class. It may be
	3.8	void generateCode(Call _call, String _insert)
		Class Call offers classifying and identifying methods:
		boolean Call.isAssignment(String line),
		boolean Call.isProcedureCall(String line),
		boolean Call.isFunctionCall(String line),
		Function getCalledRoutine() - works only for single-line Calls.
	3.9	void generateCode(Jump _jump, String _indent)
		Class Jump is going to offer the following classification
		methods:
		boolean isLeave() - returns true if it's a break/leave,
		boolean isReturn() - returns true if it's a function return,
		boolean isExit() - returns true if it's a program exit,
		boolean isThrow() - returns true if it throws an exception.
		The generator may still have to analyse the code lines and
		identify the respective keywords in order to isolate values.
		See section 4.1 how to getb the configured keywords.
		Even more important is the jumpTable member inherited from
		and automatically prepared by the Generator base class: it
		maps Jump elements and elements left by a jump (loops) to
		reference ids such that both can be matched easily or unique
		jump labels may be derived from.
	3.10	void generateCode(Parallel _para, String _indent)
		Depending on whether the language supports concurrency either
		a working multithreading section should be derived or at least
		a sequential concatenation of the parallel branches is to be
		produced, ideally marked with bold comments (see examples in
		the Generator subclasses).
	3.11	void generateCode(Try _try, String _indent)
		Depending on whether the language supports exception handling
		either a working try block (possibly with finally clause) is
		to be produced or at least a sequential concatenation of the
		try and the finally block with some bold comments (see examples
		in the Generator subclasses).
	3.12	void generateCode(Root, String _indent)
		This method builds the outer code framework for the algorithm
		(i.e. the program, procedure or function definition), usually
		consisting of the header, a "preamble" (containing e.g. variable
		declarations), the implementation part, the result compilation,
		and a footer. See Generator.generateCode(Root, String) for the
		general template. Now you have two options:
		a)	Either you may override generateCode(Root, String) as a
			whole if the substructure template doesn't suit your
			target language needs,
		b)	or you may leave the base method as is and override the
			submethods (see their Java doc and the examples you may
			find in various Generator subclasses):
			String generateHeader(Root, ...),
			String generatePreamble(Root, ...),
			String generateResult(Root, ...),
			void generateFooter(Root, ...).
			
4.	Export options and other preferences to be considered
	4.1	Parser Preferences
		For certain kinds of analysis (e.g. in generateCode(Jump,...))
		some of the configured Parser Preferences may be needed. They
		can be retrieved by method D7Parser.getKeyword(String tag)
		which returns the configured keyword.
		These are the defined tags for the keyword retrieval (do never
		check against hard-coded keywords like e.g. "break"!):
		"preAlt", "posAlt" for Alternatives (if statements),
		"preFor", "postFor", "stepFor" for classical FOR loops,
		"preForIn", "postForIn" for FOR loops of FOR-IN style,
		"preWhile", "postWhile" for WHILE lop conditions,
		"preRepeat", "postRepeat" for REPEAT loop conditions,
		"preCase" for the CASE discriminator,
		"postCase" for the branch selectors of CASE elements,
		"preLeave" for leave (or break) instructions,
		"preReturn" for return statements,
		"preExit" for program exit instructions,
		"preThrow" for raising exceptions,
		"input", "output" for input and output instructions.
	4.2	Export options
		(TODO)
		
5.	Helper methods for element text transformation
	The most important helper methods are:
	5.1	String transform(String) with several submethods
		Either this method or its submethods (like transformTokens())
		or both should be overridden in order to do he necessary
		transformations of the expression syntax. It is recommended
		to do as much as possible with the transformTokens() method
		which obtains and manipulates a list of lexical tokens allowing
		more precise manipulation than e.g. with regular expressions
		or mere string replacements.
	5.2	void insertComment(Element _ele, String _indent)
		Just adds the element comment from the structogram with the given
		indentation.
	5.3	void insertComment(String _comment, String _indent)
		Inserts the given _comment string as comment to the code (with the
		given indentation)
	5.4	void insertBlockComment(StringList, _commentLines, String _indent,
			String _start, String _cont, String _end)
		This inserts the _commentLines as a multi-line comment block
		with indentation _indent, where _start is the opening delimiter
		(e.g. "/*" for C or "/**" for JavaDoc), _cont an optional
		continuation marker for the beginnings of the intermediate comment
		lines (e.g. " *"), and _end is the closing delimiter (e.g. "*/").
	5.5	boolean insertAsComment(Element _ele, String _indent)
		This inserts the instruction text as a comment if the respective
		export option (see section 4) requires so. The result is true in
		this case (such that no further export activity is necessary for
		this element) or false otherwise, meaning that a regular export
		is to be done.
	5.6	void code.add(String line)
		The raw line export, the indentation must be prefix part of line,
		a newline will automatically be added.
	5.7	void addCode(String text, String _indent, boolean asComment)
		Like code.add() but with separate indentation parameter (such that
		text shall NOT contain the indentation) and an integrated opportunity
		to add the code in translated, but "outcommented" form. The last
		argument should typically be set with the isDisabled() property of
		the element to be exported (method addCode has no own access to the
		element). The comment delimiters will be placed at the line beginnings
		whereas the outcommented code itself will be properly indented within
		the comment.
	...
	(TODO to be continued and explained)
	
6.	Setup to support the FileAPI
	Structorizer provides an executable proprietary API for text files.
	You may want either to replace the FileAPI routine calls by equi-
	valent target language constructs or to provide an emulation of
	the routines of the Structorizer FileAPI in the target language,
	which should then be integrated in the export.
	If you decide to implement an emulation then you should place this
	implementation as subroutine definitions of the target language
	into a file with name "FileAPI.xxx.txt" where "xxx" is to be replaced
	by the file name extension of your target language. Mark the code
	range to be inserted into the export file with
	
7.	Add the generator to the plugin configuration
	Find the resource file generators.xml in the ...structorizer.gui
	package directory and add a new <plugin> entry with a title string
	for the export menu and the fully qualified class name of the new
	generator. (If you like, you may also provide the file path for a
	16x16 pixel icon file.)
	You may use the attribute reserved_words to provide a comma-separated
	list of reserved words for this language. It will only be used by the
	Analyser, though. The configuration in the plugin file is favourized
	upon the configuration in the Generator class (cf. 2.9).
	If letter case does NOT matter (like in Pascal) you ought to provide
	an attribute case_matters="0"; the default is that case matters (as
	in C, Java etc.), so you may omit the attribute or write:
	case_matters="1".  
	
8.	Batch Mode test
	Make sure the generator also works fine in batch mode (i.e. from
	command line):
	Linux:	 	structorizer.sh -x <languageTitle> <nsdFile>
	Windows:	structorizer.bat -x <languageTitle> <nsdFile>
