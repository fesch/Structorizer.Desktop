Known issues (also see https://github.com/fesch/Structorizer.Desktop/issues):
- Copying diagram images to the clipboard may fail with some OS/JRE combination
  (#685), on Windows the image format may be JPG instead of PNG.
- Pascal import does not cope with unit name aliases. ObjectPascal code should
  be tolerated by the parser but may produce nonsense from the OOP parts.
- COBOL import may fail if certain single-letter identifiers are used (rename
  them!), it does not cope with some statement variants and variable
  redefinitions, either.
- The import option to mitigate ambiguities between closing angular brackets (in
  nested type arguments) and shift operators >> may fail in some cases. Then
  it should be switched off and closing angular brackets be separated manually.
  It does not cope with lambda expressions and some annotations. Because OOP
  context is not actually supported in Structorizer, the imported diagrams will
  usually not be executable and will raise a lot of Analyser warnings.
- Shell export neither copes with nested array/record initialisers and
  component access nor with cleanly handling usual and associative arrays as
  parameters or results.
- ARM export is still experimental and relies on a specific and very restricted
  syntax for the element contents in order to produce meaningful results.
