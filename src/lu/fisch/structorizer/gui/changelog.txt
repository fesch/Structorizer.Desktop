Known issues:
- Copying diagram images to the clipboard may fail with some OS/JRE combination (#685).
- COBOL import may fail if certain single-letter identifiers are used (rename them!).
- COBOL import doesn't cope with some statement variants and variable redefinitions.
- The Javascript generator is just a prototype and may be deficient.
- Shell export does not cope with nested array/record initializers and component access.
