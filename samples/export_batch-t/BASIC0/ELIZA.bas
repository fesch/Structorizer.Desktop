Rem 2016-10-06 Initial version 
Rem 2017-03-29 Two diagrams updated (comments translated to English) 
Rem 2017-03-29 More keywords and replies added 
Rem 2019-03-14 Replies and mapping reorganised for easier maintenance 
Rem 2019-03-15 key map joined from keyword array and index map 
Rem 2019-03-28 Keyword "bot" inserted (same reply ring as "computer") 
Rem 2019-11-28 New global type "History" (to ensure a homogenous array) 
Rem 2022-01-11 Measures against substition inversions a -> b -> a in conjugateStrings, reflexions revised.

Rem histArray contains the most recent user replies as ring buffer; 
Rem histIndex is the index where the next reply is to be stored (= index of the oldest 
Rem cached user reply). 
Rem Note: The depth of the history is to be specified by initializing a variable of this type, 
Rem e.g. for a history of depth 5: 
Rem myhistory <- History{{"", "", "", "", ""}, 0} 
Rem Associates a key word in the text with an index in the reply ring array
