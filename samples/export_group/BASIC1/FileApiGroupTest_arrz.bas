Rem NOTE: 
Rem This first module of the file is a library module providing common resources 
Rem for the following modules, which are separated by comment lines like 
Rem "======= 8< =======...". 
Rem You may have to cut this file apart at these lines in order to get the parts 
Rem running, since the following modules may form sort of mutually independent 
Rem applications or programs the coexistence of which in a single file might not 
Rem be sensible.

Rem Draws a bar chart from the array "values" of size nValues. 
Rem Turtleizer must be activated and will scale the chart into a square of 
Rem 500 x 500 pixels 
Rem Note: The function is not robust against empty array or totally equal values.

Rem Writes a text file with name fileName, consisting of count lines, each containing 
Rem a random number in the range from minVal to maxVal (both inclusive). 
Rem Returns either the number of written number if all went well or some potential 
Rem error code if something went wrong.

Rem Computes the sum and average of the numbers read from a user-specified 
Rem text file (which might have been created via generateRandomNumberFile(4)). 
Rem  
Rem This program is part of an arrangement used to test group code export (issue 
Rem #828) with FileAPI dependency. 
Rem The input check loop has been disabled (replaced by a simple unchecked input 
Rem instruction) in order to test the effect of indirect FileAPI dependency (only the 
Rem called subroutine directly requires FileAPI now).
