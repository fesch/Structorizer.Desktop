The source file samples in the subdirectories are created or updated manually
by loading a sample arrz file from folder ../arrz into Structorizer and export-
ing the associated Arrangement group from the Arranger Index via context menu
entry "Export diagram/group > ..." with the respective target language chosen.
Make sure to have export option "No conversion of the expression/instruction
contents" disabled. The default sizes for arrays / strings were configured to
50 and 128, respectively.
Ideally, the samples are updated whenever a new Structorizer version has any
substantial impact on the code generation for the target language (name diffe-
rences of generically introduced auxiliary variables are not of course regard-
ed as substantial changes).
