 * 2017-03-29 Two diagrams updated (comments translated to English)
 * 2017-03-29 More keywords and replies added
 * 2019-03-14 Replies and mapping reorganised for easier maintenance
 * 2019-03-15 key map joined from keyword array and index map
 * 2019-03-28 Keyword "bot" inserted (same reply ring as "computer")
 * 2019-11-28 New global type "History" (to ensure a homogenous array)
