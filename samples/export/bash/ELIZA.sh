# Revision history: 
# 2016-10-06 Initial version 
# 2017-03-29 Two diagrams updated (comments translated to English) 
# 2017-03-29 More keywords and replies added 
# 2019-03-14 Replies and mapping reorganised for easier maintenance 
# 2019-03-15 key map joined from keyword array and index map 
# 2019-03-28 Keyword "bot" inserted (same reply ring as "computer") 
# 2019-11-28 New global type "History" (to ensure a homogenous array) 
# 2022-01-11 Measures against substition inversions a -> b -> a in conjugateStrings, reflexions revised.
